# MoonDreamMojo
Moondream is a multimodal tiny language vision model with 1.6B parameters, designed to handle both text and image inputs, generating text-based outputs such as captions or responses based on the given input. Here the inference model has been entirely implemented in Mojo, while pre-processing (such as tokenization) and post-processing are handled in Python.
## How to use the model:
1. Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/taalhaataahir0102/MoonDreamMojo.git```

2. Download the weights file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z2AJtBZuWO2gBgzJdaMOJ0aZeNiBnQQv/view?usp=sharing).

3. Extract the weights file in the same directory.

4. make executable run file

```chmod +x run.sh```

5. Run the model using:

```./run.sh```

Model will ask for the input image and question.
